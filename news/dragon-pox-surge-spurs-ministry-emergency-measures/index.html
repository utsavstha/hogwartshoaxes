        <h2>Dragon Pox Surge Spurs Ministry Emergency Measures!</h2>
        <div class="date">March 29, 2025 | By Elphias Doge, Jr.</div>
        
        <p>A concerning spike in Dragon Pox cases across Europe and beyond has prompted the Ministry of Magic to declare a Level Three Health Emergency. St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries reports a threefold increase in admissions compared to this time last year, particularly affecting younger witches and wizards who haven&rsquo;t received the full complement of preventative charms. Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt addressed the Wizengamot this morning, outlining the Ministry&rsquo;s strategy to combat the outbreak. Key initiatives include: a mandatory Pox Protection Protocol, requiring all magical households to administer preventative charms; an accelerated production and distribution of Dragon Pox Potions by Gladrags Wizardwear (renowned for their healing textiles and potions subsidiary); and increased funding for research into more effective and long-lasting immunities, spearheaded by a team of Curse-Breakers and Potioneers led by Professor Neville Longbottom at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are taking this matter extremely seriously,&rdquo; Minister Shacklebolt stated firmly. &ldquo;Dragon Pox is a highly contagious and potentially fatal illness, and it is our duty to protect our community. We urge all witches and wizards to follow the Ministry&rsquo;s guidelines and seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms, including (but not limited to) blistering red spots, excessive sweating, and an uncontrollable urge to collect shiny objects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surge is believed to be linked to a new, more virulent strain of Dragon Pox, possibly originating from Eastern European dragon reserves. Concerns have also been raised about the potential role of unregulated magical creature handling and the illicit trade of dragon products. Auror patrols have been increased in areas known for such activities, and stricter regulations regarding dragon breeding and ownership are expected to be announced shortly.</p>
<p>Professor Longbottom urged caution against panic, emphasizing that preventative measures are highly effective when administered promptly. He also dispelled rumors of Dragon Pox being connected to dark magic, stating firmly, &ldquo;This is a biological illness, not a magical curse. Focusing on proper hygiene, preventative charms, and timely medical intervention is paramount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministry has established a Dragon Pox Information Hotline (dial 444-DRAGON-POX) for citizens with questions or concerns. St. Mungo&rsquo;s is also offering free Dragon Pox Protection Charm clinics throughout the country. The Daily Prophet will continue to provide updates on this developing situation.</p>
