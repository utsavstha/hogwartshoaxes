<p>The Ministry of Magic is facing increasing pressure to address what some are calling a &lsquo;wizarding climate crisis.&rsquo; Reports are flooding in from across the British Isles detailing unsettling magical weather patterns and unusual ecological disruptions. Herbologists are particularly concerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Venus Flytraps used to enjoy a good, consistent downpour,&rsquo; explained Professor Sprout in an exclusive interview with the Prophet. &lsquo;Now, we have week-long droughts followed by deluges of enchanted rain that corrode the soil. My Mandrakes are simply <em>furious</em>.&rsquo;</p></p>

            <p><p>For centuries, wizarding society has enjoyed a relatively stable relationship with the natural world. Our enchantments nurtured flourishing Herbology, our potions depended on predictable ingredients, and Quidditch games rarely faced cancellation due to excessive…well, anything beyond the occasional rogue Bludger. But whispers of change, unsettling shifts in the magical ecosystem, are growing louder, demanding our attention.</p>
<p>Firstly, aurors have been reporting a dramatic decrease in populations of Vermiculus, the common garden pest used in several essential potions. Madame Sprout, Head of Herbology at Hogwarts, confirms that Wormcasts, a key ingredient in strengthening Mandrakes, are becoming increasingly rare. Theories abound, from over-harvesting by unscrupulous potion ingredient dealers to subtle shifts in magical ley lines affecting breeding patterns. Whatever the cause, the ramifications for potion-making could be devastating.</p></p>

<p>Whispers have grown to shouts in the stands, and even the Wizengamot is taking notice: the increasingly erratic weather during Quidditch matches isn&rsquo;t just bad luck. A growing consensus amongst magical meteorologists, spearheaded by Professor Aurora Sinistra (Astronomy Department, Hogwarts), points to &lsquo;Atmospheric Unbalancing&rsquo; – a wizarding analogue to the Muggle concept of Climate Change. The culprit? Broomstick emissions, particularly from high-performance models like the Firebolt and the Comet series.</p></p>
