      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wizengamot is in a right tizzy, dear readers! Ever since Arthur Weasley, bless his perpetually tinkering heart, managed to ‘accidentally’ animate a set of Beater’s bats with rudimentary rune sequences (resulting in a near-fatal incident involving Madam Pomfrey&amp;rsquo;s prize-winning begonias), the debate surrounding Enchanted Automata in Quidditch has exploded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some, like former Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge (who, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, would probably endorse a self-stirring tea kettle as a revolutionary innovation), see it as the next step in sporting evolution. “Imagine,” he boomed at a recent Ministry press conference, nearly knocking over a stack of Goblin Gazette articles with his enthusiasm (and considerable girth), “Self-guiding Quaffles! Auto-blasting Bludgers! Chasers with the strategic prowess of a house-elf plotting revenge on a particularly cruel master!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wizengamot Inquiry into Zymurgical Enhancements (W.I.Z.E.), chaired by none other than former Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, held a tense hearing yesterday regarding the burgeoning field of &amp;lsquo;Automated Wizarding Aids.&amp;rsquo; The core debate? Where does a helpful self-stirring cauldron end, and a potentially rogue, potion-brewing overlord begin?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We must proceed with caution!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office (ironically, now overseeing the responsible &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; of magic to mundane tasks). He presented a compelling, if somewhat rambling, case involving a toaster that developed a disturbing fondness for transfiguring bread into miniature gnomes. &amp;ldquo;Imagine that, but with a cauldron and a particularly potent love potion!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
