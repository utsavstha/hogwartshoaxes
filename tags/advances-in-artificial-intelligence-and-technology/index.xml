      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Barnaby Bumble, Correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We wizards and witches pride ourselves on tradition, on the personal touch, on the exquisite nuance of a well-placed flick of the wrist. But lately, a disturbing trend has emerged from the dingy workshops of innovation-obsessed enchanters: &amp;lsquo;Automated Magic.&amp;rsquo; And frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s giving me the heebie-jeebies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started innocently enough. Self-stirring cauldrons – a boon for those of us cursed with perpetually cramped fingers after hours of brewing Wiggenweld Potion. (Thanks, Professor Sprout&amp;rsquo;s extra credit assignments in sixth year!). Then came self-sharpening quills, allegedly inspired by Hermione Granger&amp;rsquo;s tireless campaign against repetitive Strain Injury in the Ministry. Now, we’re hearing whispers of &amp;lsquo;Automated Wand Movement&amp;rsquo; modules – little gizmos that, supposedly, can perform simple charms on your behalf. I even heard rumours that someone (cough, &lt;em&gt;Zabini&lt;/em&gt;, cough) is developing a self-folding laundry charm. Lazy is as lazy does, I always say!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Barnaby Bagman, Unrepentant Luddite (and Slightly Singed Eyebrows)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Merlin&amp;rsquo;s sake, where does it end? First, they gave us self-stirring cauldrons, promising to free up valuable time for &amp;lsquo;more important pursuits&amp;rsquo;. More important than &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt; stirring a potion, I ask you? Than ensuring the correct consistency, the perfect clockwise rotation that only years of experience can provide? Now, I hear whispers – &lt;em&gt;whispers!&lt;/em&gt; – of self-cleaning wands, charms that &amp;rsquo;learn&amp;rsquo; your preferred casting style, and even, dare I say it, enchanted quills capable of writing essays for you. Utter madness!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
