      <description>&lt;p&gt;HOGWARTS, SCOTLAND - A sudden surge in Dragon Pox cases has swept through the wizarding world, igniting a fierce debate about healthcare access. While St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is reportedly stretched thin, many are questioning whether the current system adequately serves all members of our society, especially those with… shall we say… limited financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reports are flooding in from families claiming they can&amp;rsquo;t afford the exorbitantly priced Dragon Pox Potion (ingredients include powdered Norwegian Ridgeback claw, you see). Healers are citing increased ingredient costs and the general economic instability caused by You-Know-Who&amp;rsquo;s… unfortunate reign, as reasons for the rising prices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
