      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Barnaby Bumble, Political Correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never has the wizarding world felt so… divided. Since Britain&amp;rsquo;s rather messy (and, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, utterly chaotic) &amp;lsquo;Wiz-it&amp;rsquo; from the International Confederation of Wizards (ICW), tensions have been simmering like Snape&amp;rsquo;s cauldron during a particularly disastrous potions lesson. The Ministry of Magic, currently under the rather &lt;em&gt;enthusiastic&lt;/em&gt; leadership of Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt, assures us all is well. But is it, really?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fallout from Wiz-it continues to plague trade agreements. Gringotts, predictably, is making a killing on exchange rates, charging exorbitant fees to those attempting to import Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder (essential for any self-respecting prankster, I might add). Madame Rosmerta, bless her soul, is reportedly struggling to import butterbeer ingredients from Bavaria, claiming tariffs are higher than a Hippogriff on a particularly good hair day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quidditch Pitch Politics: Are We Headed for Another House Cup Cold War?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wizarding world, much like its Muggle counterpart (so I&amp;rsquo;m told, though I personally find crosswords far more engaging than &amp;lsquo;geopolitics&amp;rsquo;), finds itself teetering on the precipice of&amp;hellip; well, something unpleasant. The precise nature of that &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; is, as ever, hotly debated at the Ministry, usually over lukewarm pumpkin juice and stale rock cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent international Quidditch tournament in Bucharest has, predictably, become less about bludgers and more about blatant displays of national pride. The Bulgarian Seeker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;accidental&amp;rsquo; collision with the Romanian Chaser (resulting in a rather fetching shade of purple and a broken Firebolt) has sparked a diplomatic incident that even Madam Bones is struggling to mediate. Sources tell me she’s already exhausted her supply of calming draughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
