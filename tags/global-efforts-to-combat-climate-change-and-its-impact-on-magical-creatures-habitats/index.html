            <p><p>In a move that&rsquo;s been hailed as &rsquo;long overdue&rsquo; by some (Neville Longbottom, we&rsquo;re looking at you!), the International Confederation of Wizards has announced a series of sweeping initiatives aimed at combating the increasingly erratic weather patterns affecting magical creature habitats worldwide.</p>
<p>Speaking from the newly renovated Ministry of Magic atrium (now boasting energy-efficient Lumos Charms instead of gas lamps, thanks to Hermione Granger&rsquo;s relentless lobbying), Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt declared, &ldquo;The evidence is undeniable. Dragons are suffering unprecedented levels of heat stroke. Bowtruckles are struggling to find adequate wand-quality trees due to deforestation. And even the elusive Crumple-Horned Snorkacks are reportedly migrating further south, driven by rising sea levels. This is not a laughing matter! (Except perhaps to Luna Lovegood, who believes they&rsquo;re merely searching for better hats.)&rdquo;</p></p>

<p>The Ministry of Magic, after years of, shall we say, <em>robust</em> debate (mostly between the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office about who was responsible for the rogue self-stirring cauldron incident in the Scottish Highlands), has finally launched a comprehensive initiative to combat the increasingly erratic climate and its devastating impact on magical creature habitats.</p></p>
