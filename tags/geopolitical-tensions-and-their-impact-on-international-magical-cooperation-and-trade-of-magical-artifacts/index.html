<p>The wizarding world, bless its pointy hat, has always fancied itself a bit above the fray. While Muggles fret about their &lsquo;geopolitical tensions&rsquo; (a rather drab term, if you ask me), we’ve been generally preoccupied with, well, slightly more interesting things. Dragons, for instance. Or the surprisingly complex bureaucracy involved in approving new Floo Powder routes. However, recent&hellip; disagreements&hellip; between several Ministries are starting to make even the most oblivious house-elf notice the stench. And I&rsquo;m not talking about Kreacher&rsquo;s usual Monday morning stew.</p></p>

            <p><p>For centuries, the wizarding world has largely managed to operate in its own little enchanted bubble, blissfully unaware (or perhaps willfully ignoring) the increasingly volatile cauldron of geopolitical tensions brewing amongst our Muggle counterparts. Sadly, that bubble is starting to leak, and the stench of international discord is beginning to permeate even the hallowed halls of Hogwarts and the bustling shops of Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Recent tensions between, let&rsquo;s say, &lsquo;Northern Magical Conglomerate A&rsquo; and &lsquo;Southern Magical Federation B&rsquo; (names have been changed to protect the guilty… and avoid potential jinxings) are having a palpable impact on the international trade of magical artifacts and ingredients. Take Gillyweed, for example. Used to be, you could owl order a bushel of the stuff from Transylvania faster than you could say &lsquo;Aguamenti.&rsquo; Now? Forget about it! Trade embargos and import restrictions have made it scarcer than a decent Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Madam Pomfrey is practically rationing the stuff, leading to a veritable underwater breathing crisis amongst our younger, more adventurous students.</p></p>
