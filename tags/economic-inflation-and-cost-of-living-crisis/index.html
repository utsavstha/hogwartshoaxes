<p>The wizarding world, usually blissfully insulated from Muggle woes, is beginning to feel a pinch tighter than a freshly woven Mandrake earmuff. Whispers of &rsquo;economic inflation&rsquo; and a &lsquo;cost of living crisis&rsquo; are swirling through the Leaky Cauldron like a particularly potent pepper-up potion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It used to be,&rdquo; lamented Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, &ldquo;that a sickle could buy you a decent collection of spark plugs. Now? You&rsquo;re lucky to get a bent paperclip from a secondhand Muggle dealer. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on rubber ducks! Their prices have gone quackers!&rdquo; Mr. Weasley, however, remains optimistic, suggesting a possible solution involving enchanted postage stamps, though details are vague and involve far too much glitter for this reporter&rsquo;s liking.</p></p>

<p>Wizarding Britain is facing a crisis. Forget You-Know-Who – the real Dark Lord lurking in the shadows is Inflation. Yes, dear readers, even we, shielded by Gringotts’ gold reserves (apparently not shielded enough!), are feeling the pinch. The price of a basic cauldron has skyrocketed higher than Neville Longbottom on a Firebolt! And don&rsquo;t even get me started on dragon dung fertiliser; it’s practically rarer than a happy Ministry employee.</p></p>

<p>The price of Pumpkin Pasties has skyrocketed. Gillyweed is practically liquid gold (ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?). And rumour has it, even Cornelius Fudge is tightening his purse strings – though that might just be because he’s finally run out of official Ministry stationery to pilfer. The wizarding world is feeling the pinch, folks. Inflation, that dreaded M-word (no, not Muggle, Monetary!), has reared its ugly head, and our galleons aren&rsquo;t stretching as far as they used to.</p></p>
