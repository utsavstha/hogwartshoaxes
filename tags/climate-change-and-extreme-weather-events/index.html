            <p><p>The Ministry of Magic is under intense pressure after a series of increasingly bizarre weather phenomena have plagued the British Isles. Last Tuesday, Hogsmeade experienced a sudden downpour of treacle tart juice, while Diagon Alley saw an unexpected blizzard of dungbombs (thankfully, dud ones, according to Fred and George Weasley, who are, as usual, suspected). Experts are now pointing fingers at a possible &lsquo;Magical Imbalance,&rsquo; a theory dismissed by the Ministry just last year as &lsquo;utter rot dreamed up by House-Elves on particularly potent pumpkin juice&rsquo;.</p></p>

            <p><p>Diagon Alley was plunged into chaos last Tuesday when an unpredicted blizzard, rivaling anything seen in Hogsmeade at Christmas, descended upon the unsuspecting shoppers. The normally bustling street was rendered almost impassable as snowdrifts reached nearly five feet in height. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, who was reportedly stranded outside Flourish and Blotts, attempting to understand how Muggle snow boots work. &ldquo;Back in my day, a bit of snow was just a bit of snow. Now? It&rsquo;s trying to bury Gringotts!&rdquo;</p></p>

            <p><p>The Quidditch season is barely a fortnight old, and already whispers of doom are circulating faster than a Firebolt on Nitrous Oxide. Forget Rita Skeeter’s scandalous (and entirely fabricated) love triangles, the real drama is in the sky – or rather, what&rsquo;s falling from it.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s match between the Holyhead Harpies and the Montrose Magpies was suspended in the third quarter when a sudden hailstorm, described by veteran referee Horace Slughorn as &rsquo;larger than Dragon eggs, and twice as unpleasant,&rsquo; bombarded the pitch. Players and spectators alike were forced to seek refuge under hastily erected Protego charms, leading to several amusing (but reportedly painful) incidents involving stray Bludgers ricocheting off said charms.</p></p>

            <p><p>Across the British Isles and beyond, Quidditch enthusiasts are facing an unprecedented challenge: unpredictable and downright dangerous weather patterns. Forget a bit of drizzle during a match; we&rsquo;re talking rogue blizzards in July, spontaneously combusting goalposts, and winds so strong they turn Quaffles into miniature, high-speed Seeking Snitches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it!&rdquo; exclaimed Madam Hooch, Headmistress of Flying at Hogwarts. &ldquo;One minute you&rsquo;re demonstrating a simple loop-the-loop, the next you&rsquo;re dodging a flock of flamingos that seem to have Apparated straight from the Sahara – in the middle of Scotland! The brooms are struggling to compensate. Honestly, it&rsquo;s a wonder the students haven&rsquo;t spontaneously developed gills!&rdquo;</p></p>
