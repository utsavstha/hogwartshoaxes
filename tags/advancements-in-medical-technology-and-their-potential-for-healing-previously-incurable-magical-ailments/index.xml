      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Elara Quirke, Healer Extraordinaire (and Secret Muggle Tech Enthusiast)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Magic has long held aâ€¦ shall we say, &lt;em&gt;cautious&lt;/em&gt; view of Muggle technology. From Arthur Weasley&amp;rsquo;s hilarious (and occasionally hazardous) attempts to understand plugs, to the outright dismissal of &amp;rsquo;non-magical solutions&amp;rsquo; by certain, &lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;, Pure-blood families (Lucius Malfoy, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at you!), the prevailing attitude has been one of skepticism. However, whispers are now emerging from St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s that a radical new approach is being quietly explored: incorporating Muggle medical advancements into our healing practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
