      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diagon Alley is in a state of controlled chaos this morning after reports of a highly contagious, and frankly rather embarrassing, new strain of Dragon Pox have surfaced. Initial cases were identified amongst goblin-run banking employees at Gringotts, leading some to speculate on the involvement of dark magic, or perhaps just exceptionally unsanitary gold-counting practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Magic&amp;rsquo;s Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, along with a hastily assembled team of Healers from St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s, are working tirelessly to contain the outbreak. Head Healer Augusta Longbottom (n√©e Bell) issued a statement earlier this morning urging calm, while simultaneously hoarding the entire St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s bezoar supply. &amp;ldquo;There is no need for panic,&amp;rdquo; she declared, her eyes darting suspiciously around the press conference. &amp;ldquo;Simply avoid close contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms. And for Merlin&amp;rsquo;s sake, wash your hands after handling galleons!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
