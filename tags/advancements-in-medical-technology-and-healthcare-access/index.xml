      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wizarding World is on the cusp of a healthcare renaissance! After decades of stagnation, significant advancements in diagnostic and healing magic are being implemented across St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s and smaller clinics. Chief Healer Augusta Longbottom (nee Abbott) announced yesterday a revolutionary new application of Legilimency – termed &amp;lsquo;Cognitive Resonance Therapy&amp;rsquo; – developed in collaboration with Professor Severus Snape (posthumously, using his extensive notes and recovered memory vials). This innovative technique allows trained Mind-Healers to gently guide patients through trauma and deeply rooted anxieties without the invasive and potentially damaging effects of traditional Legilimency. Initial trials show remarkable success in treating victims of long-term Imperius Curse exposure and post-Azkaban syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
