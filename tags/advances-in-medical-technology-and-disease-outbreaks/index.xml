      <description>&lt;p&gt;BREAKING NEWS: St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is bracing for a surge in cases of &amp;lsquo;Fluctuating Fortescue,&amp;rsquo; a highly contagious (and frankly, rather embarrassing) strain of Magical Measles sweeping across Wizarding Britain. The Ministry of Magic&amp;rsquo;s Department of Magical Health has issued an urgent advisory, urging witches and wizards to immediately consult their Healers if they experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, as described by Healer Smethwyck at St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s, include: &amp;ldquo;Unpredictable changes in ice cream flavor preferences â€“ one minute you&amp;rsquo;re craving a Knickerbocker Glory, the next it&amp;rsquo;s a Cauldron Cake compulsion! In extreme cases, patients have been observed attempting to transfigure everyday objects into various frozen confections. We also note an increased susceptibility to jinxes involving dairy products.&amp;rdquo; Healer Smethwyck was unfortunately unavailable for further comment as he was last seen wrestling a rogue garden gnome attempting to churn butter with its beard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
