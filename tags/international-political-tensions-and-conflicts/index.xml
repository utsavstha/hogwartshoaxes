      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Beatrix Blotts, Political Arcanist&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those of you blissfully unaware (probably because you&amp;rsquo;re still using self-inking quills – honestly, people!), the international wizarding community isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a cauldron of bubbling bonhomie these days. While the Ministry of Magic assures us that everything is &amp;ldquo;perfectly splendid, just splendid,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m here to tell you it&amp;rsquo;s more like a simmering stew of suspicion, secrets, and suspiciously strong potions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s address the Norwegian Ridgeback in the room: magical creature control. Our esteemed Minister Shacklebolt’s well-intentioned but, let’s face it, slightly impractical “Global Initiative for Responsible Dragon Ownership” (GIRDO) is about as effective as a chocolate teapot. Romania, a nation practically built on dragon reserves, accuses Britain of hypocrisy, citing Hagrid&amp;rsquo;s… &lt;em&gt;adventures&lt;/em&gt;… as Exhibit A. Meanwhile, the Bulgarians are suspiciously silent, leading some to suspect they&amp;rsquo;re breeding a new breed of particularly grumpy dragons specifically to undermine GIRDO. Honestly, you&amp;rsquo;d think after the Triwizard Tournament fiasco, we&amp;rsquo;d be done with the dragons for a bit. No such luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Beatrice Bootlace, International Affairs Correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers, are you finding your cauldron overflowing with unease these days? Me too! It&amp;rsquo;s not just the price of powdered dragon claw soaring sky-high (thanks, Brexit!), but the simmering tensions between various magical communities that are giving me the galloping gales. Let&amp;rsquo;s delve, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the ongoing Goblet of Fire Dispute with Bulgaria. Apparently, someone – and sources strongly suggest it was Viktor Krum, attempting to relive his glory days – bewitched the Goblet to only accept entries written in Bulgarian. Chaos ensued! Madam Zabini (senior, naturally) nearly lost a perfectly good set of false teeth trying to slip a translation charm in. Relations are frosty, and I hear the Ministry is considering sanctions – no importing Bulgarian Bludgers, perhaps? That’ll teach ‘em!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
