<p>For those of you blissfully unaware (probably because you&rsquo;re still using self-inking quills – honestly, people!), the international wizarding community isn&rsquo;t exactly a cauldron of bubbling bonhomie these days. While the Ministry of Magic assures us that everything is &ldquo;perfectly splendid, just splendid,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m here to tell you it&rsquo;s more like a simmering stew of suspicion, secrets, and suspiciously strong potions.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s address the Norwegian Ridgeback in the room: magical creature control. Our esteemed Minister Shacklebolt’s well-intentioned but, let’s face it, slightly impractical “Global Initiative for Responsible Dragon Ownership” (GIRDO) is about as effective as a chocolate teapot. Romania, a nation practically built on dragon reserves, accuses Britain of hypocrisy, citing Hagrid&rsquo;s… <em>adventures</em>… as Exhibit A. Meanwhile, the Bulgarians are suspiciously silent, leading some to suspect they&rsquo;re breeding a new breed of particularly grumpy dragons specifically to undermine GIRDO. Honestly, you&rsquo;d think after the Triwizard Tournament fiasco, we&rsquo;d be done with the dragons for a bit. No such luck.</p></p>

<p>Dear Readers, are you finding your cauldron overflowing with unease these days? Me too! It&rsquo;s not just the price of powdered dragon claw soaring sky-high (thanks, Brexit!), but the simmering tensions between various magical communities that are giving me the galloping gales. Let&rsquo;s delve, shall we?</p>
<p>Firstly, the ongoing Goblet of Fire Dispute with Bulgaria. Apparently, someone – and sources strongly suggest it was Viktor Krum, attempting to relive his glory days – bewitched the Goblet to only accept entries written in Bulgarian. Chaos ensued! Madam Zabini (senior, naturally) nearly lost a perfectly good set of false teeth trying to slip a translation charm in. Relations are frosty, and I hear the Ministry is considering sanctions – no importing Bulgarian Bludgers, perhaps? That’ll teach ‘em!</p></p>
