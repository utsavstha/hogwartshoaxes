      <description>&lt;p&gt;A concerning spike in Dragon Pox cases across Europe and beyond has prompted the Ministry of Magic to declare a Level Three Health Emergency. St. Mungo&amp;rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries reports a threefold increase in admissions compared to this time last year, particularly affecting younger witches and wizards who haven&amp;rsquo;t received the full complement of preventative charms. Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt addressed the Wizengamot this morning, outlining the Ministry&amp;rsquo;s strategy to combat the outbreak. Key initiatives include: a mandatory Pox Protection Protocol, requiring all magical households to administer preventative charms; an accelerated production and distribution of Dragon Pox Potions by Gladrags Wizardwear (renowned for their healing textiles and potions subsidiary); and increased funding for research into more effective and long-lasting immunities, spearheaded by a team of Curse-Breakers and Potioneers led by Professor Neville Longbottom at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
