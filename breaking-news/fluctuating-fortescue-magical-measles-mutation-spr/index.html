        <h2>Fluctuating Fortescue: Magical Measles Mutation Spreads Through Wizarding Britain!</h2>
        <div class="date">April 8, 2025 | By Barnaby Broadbent</div>
        
        <p>BREAKING NEWS: St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is bracing for a surge in cases of &lsquo;Fluctuating Fortescue,&rsquo; a highly contagious (and frankly, rather embarrassing) strain of Magical Measles sweeping across Wizarding Britain. The Ministry of Magic&rsquo;s Department of Magical Health has issued an urgent advisory, urging witches and wizards to immediately consult their Healers if they experience symptoms.</p>
<p>Symptoms, as described by Healer Smethwyck at St. Mungo&rsquo;s, include: &ldquo;Unpredictable changes in ice cream flavor preferences – one minute you&rsquo;re craving a Knickerbocker Glory, the next it&rsquo;s a Cauldron Cake compulsion! In extreme cases, patients have been observed attempting to transfigure everyday objects into various frozen confections. We also note an increased susceptibility to jinxes involving dairy products.&rdquo; Healer Smethwyck was unfortunately unavailable for further comment as he was last seen wrestling a rogue garden gnome attempting to churn butter with its beard.</p>
<p>Rumours are swirling that the mutation may be linked to a recent (and unauthorized) experiment by Gilderoy Lockhart (currently residing in a secure ward at St. Mungo&rsquo;s) involving a particularly potent batch of Forgetfulness Potions and a malfunctioning ice cream maker. The Ministry neither confirms nor denies this, but a spokesperson did state that &lsquo;Mr. Lockhart&rsquo;s contributions to medical advancement remain…questionable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In other news, a breakthrough has been announced at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! Professor Snape (posthumously, of course, through the meticulous notes left behind) had apparently been working on a Draught of Living Lavender which, according to current Potions Master Slughorn, shows remarkable promise in boosting immunity against Fluctuating Fortescue. &lsquo;A shame he&rsquo;s not here to see it,&rsquo; lamented Professor Slughorn, &lsquo;Though I suspect he&rsquo;d find a way to take all the credit anyway!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Ministry urges calm and encourages the consumption of properly brewed potions (and only <em>authorized</em> ice cream). Remember, a clean wand is a happy wand! (And keeps the Cauldron Cakes away&hellip;)</p>
