        <h2>BREAKING: Sprout&#39;s Super Sniffles Sweep Hogwarts! Mandrakes Blamed!</h2>
        <div class="date">April 30, 2025 | By Rita Skeeter (Probably)</div>
        
        <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is currently grappling with a sudden outbreak of what is being dubbed &lsquo;Sprout&rsquo;s Super Sniffles,&rsquo; a particularly virulent form of magical influenza. Symptoms include excessive sneezing (often resulting in accidental conjuration of small household objects), a persistent cough that sounds suspiciously like mandrake screams (without the fatal petrification, thankfully), and an inexplicable craving for pumpkin pasties.</p>
<p>Professor Pomona Sprout, Head of Herbology, is under immediate suspicion. Initial investigations point towards a rogue batch of Mandrakes, possibly cross-bred with something equally unpleasant (the details are still hazy and involve Ernie Macmillan&rsquo;s unfortunate proximity to a Whomping Willow during harvesting). Professor Sprout, when questioned, was reportedly mortified and muttered something about &rsquo;those blasted seedlings&rsquo; and &lsquo;investing in earmuffs with better Silencing Charms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey is working tirelessly, brewing extra-strength Pepperup Potions and enforcing strict bed rest. However, some students, notably the Weasley twins, are reportedly attempting to &lsquo;weaponize&rsquo; the sniffles, using Sneezing Charms to create elaborate (and highly irritating) pranks. Their current target appears to be Argus Filch, who is now sporting a rather fetching collection of self-conjured doilies glued to his face.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic has been alerted, with a team of Unspeakables dispatched to investigate the potential for wider outbreak. A spokesman for the Ministry stated, &lsquo;We urge all witches and wizards to remain calm and avoid direct contact with Mandrakes, pumpkin pasties (just to be safe), and particularly rambunctious Weasley twins. A temporary ban on Transfiguration homework involving handkerchiefs is also being considered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This reporter recommends investing in a robust Silencing Charm and a lifetime supply of tissues. And perhaps avoid Professor Sprout&rsquo;s next Herbology lesson, just in case.</p>
