        <h2>St. Mungo&#39;s Unveils &#39;Skele-Grow 2.0&#39;: Now With Added Agility and a Reduced &#39;Wobbly Leg&#39; Guarantee!</h2>
        <div class="date">March 30, 2025 | By Elara Thistlewick</div>
        
        <p>St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries announced today a breakthrough in skeletal regeneration. Lead Healer Smethwyck, sporting a rather suspiciously straight spine himself, revealed the new and improved Skele-Grow potion, dubbed &lsquo;Skele-Grow 2.0&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For years,&rsquo; Healer Smethwyck began, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow (perhaps a side effect of <em>original</em> Skele-Grow?), &lsquo;patients have complained of the dreaded &lsquo;wobbly leg&rsquo; phenomenon post-regeneration. Not to mention the… shall we say… <em>rigidity</em> some experienced. Skele-Grow 2.0 addresses these concerns directly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The potion, now infused with ethically-sourced Unicorn tail hair (the subject of a heated debate at last week&rsquo;s Unicorn Welfare Symposium), promises increased bone density and flexibility. Early trials on volunteer Skeletal Charms students have shown remarkable results. One student, initially diagnosed with a Severely-Disintegrated-Ulna-and-Radius condition after a particularly enthusiastic attempt at a Levitation Charm, was reportedly back on his Quidditch broom within a week – performing loop-the-loops and Barrel Rolls, with only a <em>minor</em> case of post-flight nausea.</p>
<p>However, the Ministry of Magic&rsquo;s Department of Magical Law Enforcement has issued a cautionary statement. &lsquo;While we applaud the advancements in healing,&rsquo; stated a Ministry spokesperson (presumably after consulting with a lawyer), &lsquo;we strongly advise against using Skele-Grow 2.0 to artificially enhance athletic performance or, Merlin forbid, to &lsquo;grow&rsquo; extra limbs. Such misuse will be met with the full force of the law, and potentially a very confused and unbalanced body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rumors persist that Draco Malfoy, reportedly suffering lingering effects from a rather unfortunate incident involving a Bludger and a particularly aggressive Hippogriff, is already on the waiting list. Healer Smethwyck declined to comment on specific patient cases, but did add, with a knowing wink, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s just say, some bones are more… stubbornly Malfoy-able than others.&rsquo;</p>
