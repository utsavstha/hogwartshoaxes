        <h2>Dragon Pox Panic Grips Diagon Alley! Healers Scramble for Bezoars as New Strain Emerges!</h2>
        <div class="date">April 6, 2025 | By Elphias Doge II</div>
        
        <p>Diagon Alley is in a state of controlled chaos this morning after reports of a highly contagious, and frankly rather embarrassing, new strain of Dragon Pox have surfaced. Initial cases were identified amongst goblin-run banking employees at Gringotts, leading some to speculate on the involvement of dark magic, or perhaps just exceptionally unsanitary gold-counting practices.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic&rsquo;s Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, along with a hastily assembled team of Healers from St. Mungo&rsquo;s, are working tirelessly to contain the outbreak. Head Healer Augusta Longbottom (née Bell) issued a statement earlier this morning urging calm, while simultaneously hoarding the entire St. Mungo&rsquo;s bezoar supply. &ldquo;There is no need for panic,&rdquo; she declared, her eyes darting suspiciously around the press conference. &ldquo;Simply avoid close contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms. And for Merlin&rsquo;s sake, wash your hands after handling galleons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new strain, dubbed &lsquo;Poxzilla&rsquo; by mischievous Hogwarts students (a nickname Headmistress McGonagall reportedly finds &lsquo;utterly inappropriate&rsquo;), is characterized by exceptionally large, bright green pustules that reportedly emit a faint but persistent odor of dungbombs. One unfortunate victim, a Mr. Barnaby Crumplepot, owner of &lsquo;Crumplepot&rsquo;s Curious Curios,&rsquo; was overheard lamenting that his new &lsquo;glow-in-the-dark&rsquo; pustules had actually increased foot traffic to his shop, though he admitted sales of Dreamless Sleep Potion had also skyrocketed.</p>
<p>The Daily Prophet has learned that Professor Severus Snape&rsquo;s old potion recipes are being desperately scoured for a potential cure, though insiders suggest his notes are mostly filled with scathing criticisms of Harry Potter’s potion-making abilities. Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt has assured the public that the situation is under control, despite rumors of a potential bezoar black market emerging in Knockturn Alley. He has urged all witches and wizards to remain vigilant and to avoid unnecessary travel. Particularly to areas known for harboring dragons&hellip; or goblins with questionable hygiene habits. More on page 3, including a helpful diagram illustrating the proper application of Wiggenweld Potion (if you can get your hands on some!).</p>
