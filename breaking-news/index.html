            <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is currently grappling with a sudden outbreak of what is being dubbed &lsquo;Sprout&rsquo;s Super Sniffles,&rsquo; a particularly virulent form of magical influenza. Symptoms include excessive sneezing (often resulting in accidental conjuration of small household objects), a persistent cough that sounds suspiciously like mandrake screams (without the fatal petrification, thankfully), and an inexplicable craving for pumpkin pasties.</p>
<p>Professor Pomona Sprout, Head of Herbology, is under immediate suspicion. Initial investigations point towards a rogue batch of Mandrakes, possibly cross-bred with something equally unpleasant (the details are still hazy and involve Ernie Macmillan&rsquo;s unfortunate proximity to a Whomping Willow during harvesting). Professor Sprout, when questioned, was reportedly mortified and muttered something about &rsquo;those blasted seedlings&rsquo; and &lsquo;investing in earmuffs with better Silencing Charms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The project, spearheaded by Head Auror Harry Potter (who insists this is NOT just an excuse to escape paperwork) and Luna Lovegood (unsurprisingly), focuses on detecting anomalies in astral projections and scouring distant constellations for traces of magical signatures.

The Ministry of Magic&rsquo;s Department of Magical Health has issued an urgent advisory, urging witches and wizards to immediately consult their Healers if they experience symptoms.</p>
<p>Symptoms, as described by Healer Smethwyck at St. Mungo&rsquo;s, include: &ldquo;Unpredictable changes in ice cream flavor preferences – one minute you&rsquo;re craving a Knickerbocker Glory, the next it&rsquo;s a Cauldron Cake compulsion! In extreme cases, patients have been observed attempting to transfigure everyday objects into various frozen confections. We also note an increased susceptibility to jinxes involving dairy products.&rdquo; Healer Smethwyck was unfortunately unavailable for further comment as he was last seen wrestling a rogue garden gnome attempting to churn butter with its beard.</p>

            <p>Diagon Alley is in a state of controlled chaos this morning after reports of a highly contagious, and frankly rather embarrassing, new strain of Dragon Pox have surfaced. Initial cases were identified amongst goblin-run banking employees at Gringotts, leading some to speculate on the involvement of dark magic, or perhaps just exceptionally unsanitary gold-counting practices.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic&rsquo;s Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, along with a hastily assembled team of Healers from St. Mungo&rsquo;s, are working tirelessly to contain the outbreak. Head Healer Augusta Longbottom (née Bell) issued a statement earlier this morning urging calm, while simultaneously hoarding the entire St. Mungo&rsquo;s bezoar supply. &ldquo;There is no need for panic,&rdquo; she declared, her eyes darting suspiciously around the press conference. &ldquo;Simply avoid close contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms. And for Merlin&rsquo;s sake, wash your hands after handling galleons!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wizarding world, once a bastion of (relatively) reliable information delivered via the Daily Prophet (and occasionally owls directly to your face), is facing a crisis of trust. An alarming rise in fantastical claims, unsubstantiated rumors, and outright fabrication, largely fueled by the resurgence of <em>The Quibbler</em>, is eroding public confidence in established news sources.</p>
<p>This reporter has observed firsthand the impact of this &lsquo;alternative facts&rsquo; phenomenon. Just last week, I attempted to purchase a self-stirring cauldron from a reputable Diagon Alley establishment only to be met with skepticism. &lsquo;Are you <em>sure</em> they work?&rsquo; the proprietor, a Mr. Gibblewort, suspiciously inquired. &lsquo;I read in <em>The Quibbler</em> that they’re all rigged by Ministry shills to sell cleaning potions!&rsquo; Apparently, Luna Lovegood (or, more accurately, her father, Xenophilius) had penned an exposé revealing a supposed conspiracy involving the Ministry, cauldron manufacturers, and a secret society of dust bunnies.</p>

            <p>HOGWARTS, SCOTLAND - A sudden surge in Dragon Pox cases has swept through the wizarding world, igniting a fierce debate about healthcare access. While St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is reportedly stretched thin, many are questioning whether the current system adequately serves all members of our society, especially those with… shall we say… limited financial resources.</p>
<p>Reports are flooding in from families claiming they can&rsquo;t afford the exorbitantly priced Dragon Pox Potion (ingredients include powdered Norwegian Ridgeback claw, you see). Healers are citing increased ingredient costs and the general economic instability caused by You-Know-Who&rsquo;s… unfortunate reign, as reasons for the rising prices.</p>

<p>Under the program, diagnostic charms and basic healing spells will be delivered via modified Howlers. Yes, you read that right. While previously associated with scathing reprimands from enraged mothers (we&rsquo;re looking at you, Weasley twins&rsquo; alumni!), Howlers are now being re-purposed for good. Each Howler will contain a self-administering diagnostic charm, which, when activated, transmits the patient&rsquo;s vital signs – magically speaking, of course – directly to a team of medi-wizards at St. Mungo&rsquo;s. They can then send back a verbal prescription and healing incantation embedded within the Howler&rsquo;s message.</p>
